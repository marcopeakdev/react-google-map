## Getting Help

**Before doing this, did you**:

1. Read the [documentation](https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps)
2. Read the [source code](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps)


_You can get someone's help in three ways_:

1. Ask on StackOverflow [with a google-maps tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-maps?sort=votes&pageSize=50) or [use react-google-maps as a keyword](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=react-google-maps)
2. Ask in [the chat room][gitter-url]
3. Create a Pull Request with your solutions to your problem

Please, be noted, **no one**, I mean, **no one**, is obligated to help you in **ANY** means. Your time is valuable, so does our contributors. Don't waste our time posting questions like “how do I do X with React-Google-Maps” and “my code doesn't work”. This is not the primary purpose of the issue tracker. Don't abuse.
