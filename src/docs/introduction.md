[`react-google-maps`][react-google-maps] provides a set of React components wrapping the underlying [Google Maps JavaScript API v3][gmjsav3] instances. Thw wrapping simply do

* **props delegation** 
* **events as callbacks**
* **lifecycle management**
* **auto-mount on map**

That's it. _Nothing more_. If you find some limitations, that might be due to [Google Maps JavaScript API v3][gmjsav3] but not [`react-google-maps`][react-google-maps].
